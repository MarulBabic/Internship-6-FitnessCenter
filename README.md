Fitness Center Database Management System

This project models a fitness center management system, focusing on managing trainers, activities, user memberships, and activity schedules. It was created as a learning exercise to practice SQL skills, including designing tables, defining relationships, and writing complex queries.

Features:

Trainers: Manage information about trainers, including their specialization and availability.

Activities: Keep track of various fitness activities offered at the center, such as yoga, cardio, or strength training.

Users: Store user information, including membership details and preferences.

Schedules: Organize and manage activity schedules to ensure efficient resource allocation and maximize user participation.

Key Concepts Covered:

Data Modeling: Designing tables with appropriate relationships and normalization.

Constraints: Ensuring data integrity with primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

Queries: Writing SQL queries to handle data insertion, retrieval, updates, and analytics.

Analytics: Analyzing user activity and trainer schedules to gain insights into usage patterns and improve service quality.

This project serves as a foundational learning tool for understanding database design and implementation while simulating a real-world use case in the fitness industry.
